## Introduction
This is a side project I've been working on. A full stack expense spliting app - splitwise clone made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Nodejs), specially designed to split group expense between friends, but can be used for almost any type of business need. With this application, you can add your expense details and get an whole expense analytics feature - Group Balance, Monthly amount spend, Catagory wise expense spending graph etc... Jump right off the [Live App](https://split-app00.herokuapp.com/) and start adding your expenses or download the entire [Source code](https://github.com/tuzup/SplitApp/) and run it on your server. This project is something I've been working on in my free time so I cannot be sure that everything will work out correctly. But I'll appreciate you if can report any issue.

## Key Features
- Create user groups and track group expense 
- Keep track of shared expenses and settle your corresponding balances in a convenient and personalized way. 
- Get Analytical graphs to understand your expenditure trend 
- Multiple user registration.
- Authentication using JSON web token (JWT)
